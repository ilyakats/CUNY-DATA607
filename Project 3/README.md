**Team 2:** Jaan Bernberg, Cesar Espitia, Georgia Galanopoulos, Ilya Kats, Michael Muller, Nkasi Nedd, Nnaemezue Obi-Eyisi, and Matheesha Thambeliyagoda.

### Project Objective

The objective is to evaluate the current state of data science job market and to analyze and
report on the most valued data science skills. The evaluation is based on collecting and
analyzing skills requested by employers since having the most commonly requested skills
increases probability of finding a desirable position thus making those skills more valuable.

### Project Findings

Among programming languages, Python and R are almost expected base skills for data
scientists. SQL dominates the database world. Hadoop and Spark are primary skills for big
data. Finally, SAS , Tableau and Excel are top data analysis tools.
